    <h1>Pig Die</h1>
    <p>Pig Die is a fun dice game that a whole family of two people can enjoy!</p>
    <h4>How to Play</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The first player rolls the dice. If they land on 1 they get no points and have to end their turn.</li>
      <li>If the player lands on anything else they can choose to keep rolling or to "hold".</li>
      <li>If the player keeps rolling, each number they land on is added to their total score until they choose to
        hold(end their turn) or
        until they land on 1, in which case their turn ends anyway AND they lose all the points they could have made in
        that turn.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat with player 2.
      <li>
      <li>First player to make it to 100 points in their total(or more) wins!</li>
    </ul>
